# Teleco-Customer-Churn-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Predictive-Analysis

This Project presents a comprehensive analysis of Telco customer churn, aiming to understand and predict customer attrition for a telecom company. It covers a range of data analysis and machine learning techniques implemented in Python, utilizing various libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow, and scikit-learn. The analysis delves into exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, data preprocessing, and the implementation of multiple machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Network, Random Forests, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines. The GitHub readme provides an in-depth walkthrough of the project, detailing each step from data collection and cleaning to model evaluation and conclusion
